# ðŸŽ¬ AI Movie Studio - Project Overview

## **Project Name:** AI Movie Studio
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Platform:** Windows Desktop Application  
**Target Users:** Professional Filmmakers, Indie Filmmakers, Students, General Users

## **Project Vision**
Create a revolutionary AI-powered desktop application for 3D animated movie production that allows users to create professional-quality movie scenes through natural language commands.

## **Core Concept**
Users interact with AI through text commands to create 3D movie scenes. The AI understands the entire 3D environment, character positions, camera angles, and scene context to intelligently place objects, cameras, and lighting.

## **Key Features**
- **AI Command System**: Natural language processing for scene creation
- **3D Movie Engine**: Custom rendering engine built for movie production
- **Character System**: Default character with basic animations
- **Camera Control**: AI-powered camera positioning and manual adjustment
- **Scene Templates**: Pre-built templates for common movie scenes
- **Real-time AI Suggestions**: AI provides suggestions while creating scenes
- **Local Database**: All data stored locally on user's computer

## **Technical Architecture**
- **Language**: C++ (core engine) + Python (AI module)
- **Graphics**: DirectX 12 (Windows native)
- **AI Framework**: PyTorch
- **Database**: SQLite (local, embedded)
- **Platform**: Windows Desktop Application

## **Development Phases**
1. **Phase 1**: Engine + UI (2-3 months)
2. **Phase 2**: AI Integration (1-2 months)  
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced Features (2-3 months)

## **Research & Development Status**
